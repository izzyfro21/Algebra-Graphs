# Algebra-Graphs
##### Uses given data to output graphs using pythons matplotlib library.

The program asks you for specific variables based on the graph you chose. Then uses a loop: 
```
  i = 0
  while(i >= x_axis):
    x.append(i)
    y.append(m*x+b)
    i = i+1
```
To add the data to the array(for the plot points).
