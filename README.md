# Algebra-Graphs
##### Uses given data to output graphs using pythons matplotlib library.

1. The program asksWhat type of equation you would like to graph
   - `What type of equation would you like to graph - Linear, Quadratic or Exponential: ` Linear

2. Then, the program asks you for the variables to impliment in the equation
   - `What are m and b (EX: 1 2): ` 2 7

3. Third, the program asks you how large hyou would like the graph and how many data points you would like plotted.
   - `What is the maximum size of the graph you would like (in units EX: 10):` 100

4. Lastly, The program will output the graphs using matplotlib.
